## Code style

A _**strict**_ code style is followed.
Please abide by the following.

- indent with 4 spaces
- use let & const, not var
- Use arrow function notation
- Braces _**must**_ open on the same line for function declarations, `if` statements, etc
- variable names should explain the utility of that variable
- use camelCase for naming variables, functions, etc.
